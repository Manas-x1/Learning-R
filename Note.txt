this is a note,

a note can help you understand the code,

specifically the code in the files,

now,since you are reading this,i suppose you dont know what R language is, (honestly,i dont know either)
but lets see what we can do with it, so i'm basically going to write some code in R language,and hopefully,
i can learn it too, but not so fast, because i'm not a programmer, i'm a guy who likes to code, and also
i can read the code, so if you can't .....well dont worry ill leave the comments for ya

so lets begain,

What is R language?
R is a programming language and software environment for statistical computing and graphics supported by the R Foundation for Statistical Computing.
The R language is widely used among statisticians and data miners for developing statistical software and data analysis. Polls, surveys of data miners,
and studies of scholarly literature databases show that R's popularity has increased substantially in recent years.

Why are we using R language? (i know you are wondering this)
Ans; simply because we can, and also because it is a good language to learn, and since we are learning about the whole data structure shinanigans,
we can use R to do it (Yaaayyyyy) but ya thats basically it, its fast, reliable, easy to use and set up (unlike that peice of shit SQL)

also, we are working on a project which requires us to use R, so we are going to use it, to deal with say....mising values, errors, and other stuff.
also makes you more qualified in that regard :D

======================================================================================================
now lets really begin,

lets start with the basics,

# is used to comment out a line of code,
print() is used to print something to the console,(its not python tho)
we use either "<-" or "=" to assign a value to a variable,
variable also work as you would expect them to work,
and all the math works and you would expect it,
and you can just print variables, dont stack them with strings tho that doesnt work,

lets talk about data types
there are 6 data types in R
1. character
2. numeric
3. integer
4. logical
5. complex

lets talk about them one by one
1. character
this is a string, it is a sequence of characters, it is enclosed in quotes
"hello world" and you know what bla bla bla.

2. numeric
this is a number like seriously, it is a number like 1.32234234234234234234234234234234234234234234234234234234234234234234234234234234234234234234234234234234234234234234234234234234234234234234234234234234234234234234234234234234234234234234234234234234234234234234234234234234234234234234234234234234234234234234
(it's a ripoff of floats)

3. integer
this is a integer like seriously like seriously its an integer, 
1,3,5,7,11 etc

4. logical
this is what you call booleans, it is either True or False

5. complex
its exactly what it sounds, just complex numbers like 1+2i or 3+4i or whatever im not typing all that,

lets talk about data structures(ya.......)
///
How data is stored in R is different from other languages
R is a vectorized language, 
so it's very important to understand how data is stored in R
///

Q.What is a vectorized language?
A.A vectorized language is a programming language that supports vector operations.
which means that it can perform operations on multiple elements at once, rather than one element at a time.
it is especially useful for performing operations on large datasets.
which is exactly what we need for our task at hand.

Q.So how does R store data?
A.R uses data structures to store data, from which we can access the data,
manipulate it and do stuff with it. like analysis and math stuff.

Q.So what are the data structures in R?
A.there are 6 data structures in R
1. vector
2. list
3. matrix
4. array
5. factor
6. data-frame
7. table
8. time-series
9. S4-class

lets talk about them one by one;
1.Vector (only one type of data type)
a vector is a one-dimensional array that holds elements of the same data-type like,
(numeric, character, logical, etc.).

2.List (multiple types of data types)
a list is a one-dimensional array that holds elements of different data-types like,
(numeric, character, logical, etc.).

3.Matrix (a vector but with 2 dimensions)
a matrix is a two-dimensional array that holds elements of the same data-type.

4.Array (a vector but with n dimensions)
an array is a n-dimensional array that holds elements of the same data-type.(honestly i dont know why it is named array when it is 3d)
(it can hold multiple dimensional data)

5.Factor (a vector but with levels and for categorical data)
a factor is a 1D array that holds elements of catagorical data. (basically contains levels)

6.Data-frame (a list but with columns and rows)
a data-frame is a 2D array that holds elements of different data-types. (basically a table)

7.Table (a data-frame but with rows and columns)
it is used with the tables liberary in R, and it is a extention of the data-frame.

8.Time-series (a vector but with time)
a time-series is a 1D array that holds elements of time. (basically a time series)(maybe we can use it for our project)

9.S4-class (a vector but with methods(specifically for object-oriented programming, like in C++))
a S4-class is a 1D array that holds elements of S4-class. (basically a class)

all of these data structures are used for their own purposes, and they are all different from each other.
using the correct data structure for the correct purpose is very important. as it will enhancee the performance of the code.
as well as making the code more readable and understandable. making the whole thing much more efficient.
