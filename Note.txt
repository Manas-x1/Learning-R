this is a note,

a note can help you understand the code,

specifically the code in the files,

now,since you are reading this,i suppose you dont know what R language is, (honestly,i dont know either)
but lets see what we can do with it, so i'm basically going to write some code in R language,and hopefully,
i can learn it too, but not so fast, because i'm not a programmer, i'm a guy who likes to code, and also
i can read the code, so if you can't .....well dont worry ill leave the comments for ya

so lets begain,

What is R language?
R is a programming language and software environment for statistical computing and graphics supported by the R Foundation for Statistical Computing.
The R language is widely used among statisticians and data miners for developing statistical software and data analysis. Polls, surveys of data miners,
and studies of scholarly literature databases show that R's popularity has increased substantially in recent years.

Why are we using R language? (i know you are wondering this)
Ans; simply because we can, and also because it is a good language to learn, and since we are learning about the whole data structure shinanigans,
we can use R to do it (Yaaayyyyy) but ya thats basically it, its fast, reliable, easy to use and set up (unlike that peice of shit SQL)

also, we are working on a project which requires us to use R, so we are going to use it, to deal with say....mising values, errors, and other stuff.
also makes you more qualified in that regard :D

======================================================================================================
now lets really begin,

lets start with the basics,

# is used to comment out a line of code,
print() is used to print something to the console,(its not python tho)
we use either "<-" or "=" to assign a value to a variable,
variable also work as you would expect them to work,
and all the math works and you would expect it,
and you can just print variables, dont stack them with strings tho that doesnt work,

lets talk about data types
there are 6 data types in R
1. character
2. numeric
3. integer
4. logical
5. complex

lets talk about them one by one
1. character
this is a string, it is a sequence of characters, it is enclosed in quotes
"hello world" and you know what bla bla bla.

2. numeric
this is a number like seriously, it is a number like 1.32234234234234234234234234234234234234234234234234234234234234234234234234234234234234234234234234234234234234234234234234234234234234234234234234234234234234234234234234234234234234234234234234234234234234234234234234234234234234234234234234234234234234234234
(it's a ripoff of floats)

3. integer
this is a integer like seriously like seriously its an integer, 
1,3,5,7,11 etc

4. logical
this is what you call booleans, it is either True or False

5. complex
its exactly what it sounds, just complex numbers like 1+2i or 3+4i or whatever im not typing all that,

lets talk about data structures(ya.......)
there are 6 data structures in R
1. vector
2. list
3. matrix
4. array
5. factor
6. data-frame
7. time-series
8. 

lets talk about them one by one;
1. vector
Description: One-dimensional arrays that hold elements of the same type (numeric, character, logical, etc.).
